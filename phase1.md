Perfect! I've successfully created Phase 1 of the OjoTokenMining system with all the core authentication and database foundation files. Here's a summary of what has been implemented:

## Phase 1 Complete - Files Created:

### **Database & Configuration:**
1. **`sql/database_schema.sql`** - Complete database schema with all necessary tables
2. **`config/database.php`** - PDO database connection with error handling
3. **`config/config.php`** - System-wide configuration and utility functions
4. **`config/session.php`** - Secure session management with timeout handling

### **Core Functions:**
5. **`includes/auth.php`** - User authentication, registration, and user management
6. **`includes/validation.php`** - Comprehensive form validation functions
7. **`includes/functions.php`** - Utility functions for packages, ewallet, and system operations

### **Pages:**
8. **`login.php`** - Beautiful Bootstrap login page with password toggle and CSRF protection
9. **`register.php`** - Registration page with real-time password strength and validation
10. **`index.php`** - Main entry point that redirects based on authentication status
11. **`logout.php`** - Secure logout with session destruction

## Key Features Implemented:

✅ **Security Features:**
- CSRF token protection
- Password hashing with PHP's password_hash()
- SQL injection prevention with prepared statements
- Session security with timeout and regeneration
- Input sanitization and validation

✅ **Authentication System:**
- User registration with sponsor referral system
- Login with username or email
- Role-based access control (user/admin)
- Session management with security

✅ **Database Foundation:**
- Complete schema for all system components
- Referential integrity with foreign keys
- Prepared for multi-level referral system
- Ewallet system with transaction tracking
- Package management system
- Monthly bonus tracking structure

✅ **User Experience:**
- Modern Bootstrap 5 UI with gradient designs
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Real-time password strength indicator
- Password visibility toggle
- Form validation with visual feedback
- Flash message system for user notifications

✅ **System Architecture:**
- Modular file structure for easy maintenance
- Separation of concerns (config, includes, pages)
- Error logging system
- Comprehensive validation functions
- Utility functions for common operations

## How to Set Up Phase 1:

1. **Create the directory structure** as shown in the development plan
2. **Set up MySQL database** and run the `database_schema.sql` file
3. **Update database credentials** in `config/database.php`
4. **Create logs directory** with write permissions
5. **Place all files** in their respective directories

## Default Admin Account:
- **Username:** admin
- **Email:** admin@ojotokenmining.com  
- **Password:** admin123

## What's Ready to Test:

✅ User registration with sponsor system
✅ User login/logout functionality
✅ Session management and security
✅ Database connections and basic operations
✅ Form validation and error handling
✅ CSRF protection
✅ Responsive UI components

## Next Steps (Phase 2):

Once Phase 1 is tested and working, we can proceed to Phase 2 which will include:
- User dashboard with sidebar navigation
- Package selection and purchase system
- Ewallet balance display and management
- Basic package checkout functionality

The system is now ready for testing the core authentication flow. Users can register, login, and the system will properly redirect them based on their roles (admin to admin dashboard, users to user dashboard - though these dashboard pages will be created in Phase 2).

Would you like me to proceed with Phase 2 (User Dashboard Foundation & Package System) or would you prefer to test Phase 1 first and make any adjustments?
